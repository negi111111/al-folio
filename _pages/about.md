Bio: I am a software engineer specializing in developing web applications and core machine learning algorithms. My research interests lie in the fields of Computer Vision and Machine Learning, with a particular focus on Multi-modal Deep Learning, including sensor, image, audio, and text data. Love Programming :)

Background: I graduated from the University of Electro-Communications with a Bachelor of Engineering in 2016, and completed my Masterâ€™s degree in the same field at the same university in 2018. In the same year, I joined NTT Communications Corporation, where I focused on research and development of time-series data analysis web applications, multi-modal deep learning, and AI talent development. In October 2024, I will begin my doctoral studies at Kyushu University, focusing on pattern recognition, educational data analytics, and the development of educational support systems.
